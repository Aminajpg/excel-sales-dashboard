:coffee: Project Overview

This project analyzes coffee shop sales data to identify trends, best-selling products, and peak business hours.
The goal is to support data-driven decisions in pricing, staffing, and product offerings.

📚 Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from a publicly available online source for educational purposes.
While an online tutorial was used as inspiration, all analyses, Pivot Tables, and the final dashboard were independently created by me.
